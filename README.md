## Limitations

- **Real-Time Interaction**: I don't have real-time access to running systems, so tasks requiring live interaction (e.g., SSH into servers) need external tools.
- **Up-to-Date Tools**: My knowledge is based on information up until 2023, so I may not be aware of the very latest frameworks, but I can help you search for resources and adapt to new ones quickly.
- **No Direct Hands-On Execution**: While I can provide guidance and write code, you’ll need to execute it on your systems.
